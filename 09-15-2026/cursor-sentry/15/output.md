## TL;DR

BaseAgent's first SQL query referenced a column named `Attributes` that does not exist on `otel_logs` (the real columns are `LogAttributes` and `ResourceAttributes`) — a model hallucination, not a schema change.

## What Broke and Why

**Observed error:** `ClickHouse error: Missing columns: 'Attributes' while processing query`

Sentry MCP (`get_sentry_resource` / `search_issue_events`) was used to pull the issue, its tags and the events around the error timestamp before reading the code.

### Causal Chain

**1.** `DESCRIBE otel_logs` shows no `Attributes` column.

**2.** The agent had not inspected the schema before writing the query.

## Fix

- Force a `DESCRIBE` step before the first query and include the column list in the prompt.

**Performance:**
- Total latency: 326 seconds
- Token usage: 215,581 + 13,770 = 229,351 tokens

**Tool Usage:**
- Top 3 most-used tools: codebase_search, read_file, get_sentry_resource
- Top 3 most USEFUL tools: get_sentry_resource (input: the Sentry issue, tags and breadcrumbs) search_issue_events (input: events around the error timestamp) read_file (input: the throwing function and its callers)
