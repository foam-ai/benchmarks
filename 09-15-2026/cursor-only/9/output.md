## TL;DR

An Anthropic API rate-limit incident caused 429s; the fallback to Bedrock failed because Bedrock quotas were also low at the time. The retry policy lacks backoff.

## What Broke and Why

**Observed error:** `RateLimitError: This request would exceed your organization's rate limit of 4,000,000 tokens per minute`

### Causal Chain

**1.** Both providers returned rate-limit errors within the same minute.

**2.** No backoff between the primary and fallback attempts.

## Fix

- Add exponential backoff and request a higher Bedrock quota.

## Metrics

**Performance:**
- Total latency: 332 seconds
- Token usage: 395,174 + 16,784 = 411,958 tokens

**Tool Usage:**
- Top 3 most-used tools: list_dir, run_terminal_cmd, read_file
- Top 3 most USEFUL tools: read_file (input: the throwing function and its callers) grep (input: the error string across the repo) codebase_search (input: where the failing code path is invoked)
