## TL;DR

The `porygon` issue page throws on an empty `solution` string returned by the backend; the page component is missing a null/empty guard for runs whose S3 object is empty.

## What Broke and Why

**Observed error:** `Error: Solution is empty (porygon/app/issues/[id]/page.tsx)`

### Causal Chain

**1.** `page.tsx` reads `data.solution` and throws if it is falsy.

**2.** The S3 object for the run exists but is zero bytes, which the backend passes through verbatim.

**3.** Older runs from before the solver refactor also have empty objects, so the page crashes for them too.

## Fix

- Render an 'awaiting solution' state instead of throwing on an empty string.
- Backfill empty S3 objects for affected runs.

- Top 3 most USEFUL tools: read_file (input: the throwing function and its callers) grep (input: the error string across the repo) codebase_search (input: where the failing code path is invoked)
