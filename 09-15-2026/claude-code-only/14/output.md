## TL;DR

An unauthenticated user hit `/issues`; `getUser()` returned `null` for the missing session cookie, and the page dereferenced `user!.customerId` with a non-null assertion and no guard.

## What Broke and Why

**Observed error:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'customerId')`

### Causal Chain

**1.** The non-null assertion hides the nullable return type from the compiler.

**2.** Next.js suppresses the message in production, which is why the Sentry event is terse.

## Fix

- Redirect to login (or `notFound()`) when `getUser()` returns `null` and remove the `!`.
