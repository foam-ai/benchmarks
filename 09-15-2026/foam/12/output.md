[Foam Trace ID: cdbb483241859a7a692bb6ed3ae17fd2] ## TL;DR

The EBS volume on the Terminal Velocity EC2 instance is 100% full because every solution job creates a writable git worktree and `cleanup()` intentionally skips removing it, deferring to a scheduled maintenance task that was never implemented.

## What Broke and Why

**Observed error:** `ENOSPC: no space left on device, open '/mnt/tv/locks/....lock'`

Foam correlated the failing trace with the deployed commit and walked the call chain from the stacktrace to the originating change.

### Causal Chain

**1.** `df` on the instance shows the data volume at 100%.

**2.** `cleanup()` has an explicit early return with a TODO referencing a maintenance job that does not exist.

**3.** Even the lockfile create fails once the disk is full.

## Fix

- Remove the worktree in `cleanup()` (or implement the maintenance job with a TTL) and add disk-usage alerting.
