[Foam Trace ID: 7be369752c8d524925c727795dfd3076] ## TL;DR

The new empty-solution validation is firing correctly, but on a caller bug: `runSideEffects` is called with `solverResult` while the function destructures `result`, so the value is always `undefined`.

## What Broke and Why

**Observed error:** `Error: Solution result is empty (side-effects/index.ts)`

Foam correlated the failing trace with the deployed commit and walked the call chain from the stacktrace to the originating change.

### Causal Chain

**1.** The solver produces a full solution (visible in traces) right before the throw.

**2.** Shorthand property `solverResult` at the call site vs. `result` in the destructuring pattern — TypeScript did not catch it because the parameter type is loose.

## Fix

- Rename the parameter to `solverResult` and tighten the argument type so extra/missing keys are compile errors.
