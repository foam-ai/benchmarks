[Foam Trace ID: 059245db0798d0d20c151196ae762e3c] ## TL;DR

BaseAgent's first SQL query referenced a column named `Attributes` that does not exist on `otel_logs` (the real columns are `LogAttributes` and `ResourceAttributes`) — a model hallucination, not a schema change.

## What Broke and Why

**Observed error:** `ClickHouse error: Missing columns: 'Attributes' while processing query`

Foam correlated the failing trace with the deployed commit and walked the call chain from the stacktrace to the originating change.

### Causal Chain

**1.** `DESCRIBE otel_logs` shows no `Attributes` column.

**2.** The agent had not inspected the schema before writing the query.

## Fix

- Force a `DESCRIBE` step before the first query and include the column list in the prompt.
