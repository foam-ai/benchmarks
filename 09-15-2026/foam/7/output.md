[Foam Trace ID: 7c80b7621635784677340f0f1981310a] ## TL;DR

`getProjectRoot()` in `drain3-pyodide.service.ts` switched to `import.meta.url` with only two `..` segments, resolving to `/app/mewtwo/dist/vendor/drain3` instead of `/app/mewtwo/vendor/drain3`, so Pyodide cannot find `foam_wrapper` on any service or retry.

## What Broke and Why

**Observed error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'foam_wrapper' (drain3-pyodide.service.ts)`

Foam correlated the failing trace with the deployed commit and walked the call chain from the stacktrace to the originating change.

### Causal Chain

**1.** The compiled file lives one directory deeper (`dist/services/`) than the source path the traversal was written for.

**2.** Every exception polling job fails identically on every retry — consistent with a static path bug, not a transient issue.

## Fix

- Add one more `..` level (or resolve from the package root via `process.cwd()`/`require.resolve`), as done in PR #333.
