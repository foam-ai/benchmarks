## TL;DR

An Anthropic API rate-limit incident caused 429s; the fallback to Bedrock failed because Bedrock quotas were also low at the time. The retry policy lacks backoff.

## What Broke and Why

**Observed error:** `RateLimitError: This request would exceed your organization's rate limit of 4,000,000 tokens per minute`

### Causal Chain

**1.** Both providers returned rate-limit errors within the same minute.

**2.** No backoff between the primary and fallback attempts.

## Fix

- Add exponential backoff and request a higher Bedrock quota.

## Metrics

**Performance:**
- Total latency: 426 seconds
- Token usage: 366,664 + 8,830 = 375,494 tokens

**Tool Usage:**
- Top 3 most-used tools: update_plan, read_file, shell
- Top 3 most USEFUL tools: shell (input: rg/git log over the failing service) read_file (input: the throwing function and its callers) update_plan (input: tracking the investigation steps)
